          The banking application developed using core Java is a sophisticated
          platform that offers a comprehensive range of functionalities to
          banking giants like SBI and HDFC. The application has been designed
          using the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming such
          as interface, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bank interface is the cornerstone of the application. It provides
          a blueprint for the implementation of features such as balance
          inquiry, money deposit, withdrawal, password reset, and interest rate
          calculation. The use of inheritance ensures that these features can be
          inherited by banks, thereby reducing the need for code duplication and
          promoting code reuse.
        </p>
        <p>
          The application also uses polymorphism to modify the attributes of the
          Bank interface, thereby enabling banks to customize the application
          according to their specific requirements. For instance, the
          application can be tailored to reflect the unique interest rates
          offered by different banks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Encapsulation is another crucial feature of the application that
          offers data security and privacy. It ensures that sensitive
          information such as account details, passwords, and transaction
          history are stored securely and are not accessible to unauthorized
          individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, the banking application developed using core Java is an
          efficient and secure solution that offers a seamless banking
          experience to customers. It is a testament to the power of
          object-oriented programming and demonstrates how these fundamental
          principles can be used to develop robust and scalable applications.

      <section class="main-section" id="Interface">
        <header>Interface</header>
        <p>
          In object-oriented programming, an interface is a blueprint for a
          class or a group of related classes. It defines a set of methods or
          behaviors that the class or classes implementing the interface must
          provide. The interface does not provide any implementation of the
          methods, but merely specifies the signature or the prototype of the
          methods that the implementing classes must define.
        </p>
        <p>
          The purpose of an interface is to provide a common protocol or a
          contract for communication between different classes. By defining a
          common interface, multiple classes can interact with each other
          without knowing the internal details of each other's implementation.
          This helps to promote code reuse, maintainability, and flexibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Java, an interface is defined using the interface keyword, and the
          methods declared in the interface are implicitly abstract and public.
          A class can implement one or more interfaces using the implements
          keyword, and it must provide an implementation for all the methods
          declared in the interface. A class can also extend another class and
          implement one or more interfaces at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, an interface is a powerful feature of object-oriented
          programming that allows for abstraction, decoupling, and polymorphism.
          It defines a contract between classes and provides a mechanism for
          loose coupling and high cohesion.

      <section class="main-section" id="Inheritance">
        <header>Inheritance</header>
        <p>
          Inheritance is a fundamental concept of object-oriented programming
          (OOP) that allows new classes to be based on existing classes, thereby
          inheriting the properties and behavior of the parent class. The parent
          class is also known as the superclass or base class, and the child
          class is known as the subclass or derived class.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inheritance allows the reuse of code, reducing duplication and
          improving code maintainability. The subclass can inherit attributes,
          methods, and properties from the superclass, and it can also add its
          own attributes and methods or override the existing ones. This allows
          for code customization and flexibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Java, inheritance is achieved using the extends keyword. A subclass
          can extend only one superclass, but a superclass can have multiple
          subclasses. The subclass inherits all the non-private members of the
          superclass, including its constructors, methods, and instance
          variables.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inheritance also facilitates polymorphism, which allows objects of
          different classes to be treated as if they belong to the same class.
          This enables code flexibility and reusability and can make code more
          modular and easier to maintain.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, inheritance can also lead to code complexity and tight
          coupling between classes if not used judiciously. Therefore, it is
          essential to design class hierarchies carefully and consider other OOP
          principles such as composition, aggregation, and interface
          implementation when creating classes.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Encapsulation">
        <header>Encapsulation</header>
        <p>
          Encapsulation is a fundamental concept of object-oriented programming
          (OOP) that refers to the bundling of data and methods within a single
          unit, such as a class. The primary purpose of encapsulation is to
          ensure that the data and methods are not accessible outside the class
          except through the defined methods, also known as accessors or
          mutators.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Java, encapsulation is achieved using the access modifiers -
          private, public, protected, and default (also known as
          package-private). The private modifier restricts access to the class
          itself, while the public modifier allows unrestricted access from
          outside the class. The protected modifier allows access from within
          the same package or from a subclass, and the default modifier allows
          access within the same package.
        </p>
        <p>
          Encapsulation has several benefits. It provides data security by
          preventing unauthorized access to the data, which can help prevent
          data corruption or tampering. It also enhances code maintainability
          and reusability by making it easier to change the internal
          implementation of the class without affecting other parts of the code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Encapsulation also promotes code readability and reduces code
          complexity by hiding the implementation details from the outside
          world. It enables the creation of more modular and flexible code,
          which can be easier to understand and maintain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, encapsulation is an essential principle of OOP that can help
          create more secure, maintainable, and flexible code.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Polymorphism">
        <header>Polymorphism</header>
        <p>
          Polymorphism is a fundamental concept of object-oriented programming
          (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as if
          they belong to the same class. Polymorphism enables code flexibility
          and reusability and can make code more modular and easier to maintain.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Java, polymorphism can be achieved through method overloading and
          method overriding. Method overloading involves defining multiple
          methods with the same name but different parameters in a class. The
          compiler determines which method to call based on the arguments passed
          at runtime.
        </p>
        <p>
          Method overriding involves redefining a method in the subclass with
          the same name, return type, and parameters as in the superclass. When
          the method is called using a reference variable of the superclass, the
          subclass implementation is executed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Polymorphism also involves the use of inheritance and interfaces. A
          superclass reference variable can be used to refer to objects of a
          subclass, allowing for code reuse and flexibility. An interface
          reference variable can be used to refer to objects of different
          classes that implement the same interface, enabling loose coupling and
          high cohesion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Polymorphism can also be achieved through generic programming, which
          involves creating classes or methods that can work with different data
          types, allowing for greater code reuse and flexibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, polymorphism is a powerful concept that allows for greater
          code flexibility, reusability, and maintainability in object-oriented
          programming. It enables objects of different classes to be treated as
          if they belong to the same class, providing a mechanism for code
          modularity and extensibility.

        <header>Bank as Interface</header>
        <p>
          The Bank interface is a set of methods that define the basic
          functionalities that a bank should provide. The interface specifies
          methods for checking account balance, adding and withdrawing money,
          changing password, and calculating the total interest. These methods
          take input parameters such as the password, amount of money, old and
          new password, and the number of years for calculating the interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the specified methods, the interface also mentions a
          comment regarding transferring money within the same bank. While this
          functionality is not explicitly defined in the interface, it suggests
          that it is an important feature that banks should provide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Implementing this interface allows banks, such as SBI and HDFC, to
          define their own classes and implement these methods according to
          their specific requirements. This interface serves as a blueprint for
          defining the basic functionality of a bank and enables code reuse and
          flexibility.

        <header>SBI implements Bank</header>
        <p>
          The SBI class is an implementation of the Bank interface and provides
          the functionality specific to the State Bank of India (SBI). This
          class defines methods for checking balance, adding and withdrawing
          money, changing the password, and calculating the total interest for a
          given number of years. Here are some points to understand the SBI
          class:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The SBI class has private instance variables, including balance,
            account number, password, and name.
          </li>
          <li>
            The constructor of the SBI class takes in the initial balance,
            password, and account holder name as parameters and generates a
            random UUID to assign to the account number.
          </li>
          <li>
            The checkBalance method overrides the method from the Bank interface
            and checks if the password provided matches the account password
            before returning the account balance.
          </li>
          <li>
            The addMoney method overrides the Bank interface method and adds the
            provided amount to the account balance, returning a message that
            confirms the transaction.
          </li>
          <li>
            The withdrawMoney method overrides the Bank interface method and
            withdraws the provided amount from the account balance if the
            password matches and the account has sufficient funds.
          </li>
          <li>
            The changePassword method overrides the Bank interface method and
            changes the password if the old password matches.
          </li>
          <li>
            The calculateTotalInterest method overrides the Bank interface
            method and calculates the total interest for the account balance for
            the given number of years at the SBI rate of interest.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Overall, the SBI class provides the necessary functionality to
          interact with an SBI bank account and demonstrates the use of
          interface methods to define common functionality across different bank
          implementations.
